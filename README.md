# Movie Catalogue

A Flutter-based application designed to provide users with a comprehensive catalogue of movies. The app allows users to browse, search, and view detailed information about their favorite movies.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly mobile application for movie enthusiasts. It aims to:

- Provide an intuitive interface for exploring a wide range of movies.
- Allow users to search for movies by title, genre, or release year.
- Display detailed information about each movie, including synopsis, cast, and ratings.
- Serve as a learning project for implementing Flutter best practices and modern development methodologies.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Search for movies by title or keywords.
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about selected movies.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both Android and iOS devices.
- **Offline Support**: Cache movie data for offline access (future implementation).

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The primary framework for building the application.
- **Dart**: Programming language used with Flutter.
- **REST API**: Integration with a movie database API (e.g., TMDb or OMDb) for fetching movie data.
- **Provider**: State management solution for managing app state.
- **SQLite**: Local database for caching movie data (optional).

## Methodologies

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with layers for presentation, domain, and data.
- **Agile Development**: Iterative development with regular updates and improvements.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing unit and widget tests to ensure code quality.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the app works seamlessly across different screen sizes.
